For example, \\\\$x^2 + y\\\\$ would be rendered in equation mode as $x^2+y$ (more on what the ^ means in below). to center the equation I'd use \\\\$\\\\$ x^2 + y \\\\$\\\\$, which is rendered as: \n",

Do you see what happened? the carrot operator only changed the 1, not the 10. We can get around this by wrapping the 10 in brackets like {10}. Using brackets 2^{10} will be rendered as $2^{10}$, which is much better. \n",
