    "For your unit 1 final project we're going to create a wordlebot. Wordlebot is going to require everything you've learned so far: lists, strings, arrays, dictionaries and functions. It can be a little tricky, so you're free to work together with others. However, you have to write your own solution.  \n",

    "## Get WordleWords\n",
    "To build a wordlebot we're going to need to have all the words that are  allowed in wordle. Fortunately fo us, Donald Knuth at Stanford has published a handy list of 5 letter words that we can grab off the web. "
