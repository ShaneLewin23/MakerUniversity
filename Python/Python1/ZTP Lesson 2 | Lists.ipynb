    "When writing programs, you often needs to work with lots of data. A common, and very useful 'data structure' for working with lots of data is a list.

    "I told python to set the 6th element of the list to be equal to \"dog\" (remember it starts at zero so list[5] is actually the sixth element). \n",
    "\n",
    "but its also true that I added a string to a list of integers. This is allowed in python, but usually not allowed in other languages. \n",
    "As you develop as a programmer, you'll learn that a lot of things are consistent between programming languages, such as the fact that all programming languages support lists, but the rules are often different. In C++, for example, each list can only have a specific type of object (int, string, float, class, etc.), and only that type. In python, you can create a list and put whatever you want into it. You can even put another list into a list. There are advantages to this, but be careful -- it can cause a lot of problems. You'll create some of those problems in homework assignments below. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule, avoid mixing data types in lists. There are always better ways to solve a problem than making messy data structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aside, what is 'mutable'? \n",
    "Above I said that lists are 'mutable'. This just means you can change (technically update) the elements. Many data types are what is called 'immutable' or 'not mutable', which as you can probably guess means that you cant change the elements. A string, for example, is not mutable. If you want to change a string you need to create a new one and destroy the old one. When you see the word mutable, you can think 'changeable', and immutable means 'unchangeable'. \n",
